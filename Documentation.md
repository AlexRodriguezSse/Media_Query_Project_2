DOCUMENTING THE STEPS I FOLLOWED TO BUILD THE PROJECT, It is important because this way I can internalize the concepts and in the future be able to explain to everyone. 
Notice that the creator of this content has already a written step by step of this project, but I do the same like him but on my own way, only for educational purposes
